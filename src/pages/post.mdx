# fnComponent - Functional Components in Go

>Developers wrap structs that implement the Component interface, such as a [templ](https://templ.guide) component, and use them
to create SPA-like components and applications with relative ease.

## A wrapper around familiar syntax

[templ](https://templ.guide) allows us to create components with html syntax.
```go title="component.templ"
package main

templ Button(label string) {
    <button>{label}</button>
}

templ Greeting(who string) {
  <h1>Hello, {who}!</h1>
}
```
With this special handler, we can render the button component in the client browser.
```go title="main.go"
var button = fncmp.NewFn(Button("Click me!"))
```
```go title="main.go"
func handleClick(context.Context) fncmp.FnComponent {
	return fncmp.NewFn(Greeting("Sean"))
}

func HandleMainFn(ctx context.Context) fncmp.FnComponent {
	return button.WithEvents(handleClick, fncmp.OnClick)
}
```

Package fncmp is a simple and lightweight package for creating functional components in Go. \
Components are rendered in place in the DOM and may be updated in response to both client and server side events.
This is accomplished by converting a Component to html and wrapping it in meta data. Meta data is parsed by a javascript API and likewise stored on the server.

Developers wrap structs that implement the Component interface, such as a [templ](https://templ.guide) component, and use them
to create SPA-like components and applications with relative ease.
